      <h3 class="about-me">About Me:</h3>

<!-- Main Webpage Paragraph No. 1 -->
      <p class="image-text1"> I am a fifth generation New Mexican, and while most studies show that New Mexico is nearly last in all categories of things that are "good", and nearly first in things that are "bad", my family and I have made a very good life in the Land of Enchantment, dispite the negative statistics.</p>

<!-- Main Webpage Paragraph No. 2 -->  
      <p class="image-text2"> I am currently a student enrolled in Thinkful's Software Engineering bootcamp course. I very much enjoy learning, and this course has been non-stop learning, so I have really enjoyed it. And the guidance I have received from my various support experts has been extremely helpful.</p>

<!-- Main Webpage Paragraph No. 3 --> 
      <p class="image-text3"> My journey into the tech space began a few years ago when I began to explore various coding languages and their uses. After working through some beginner courses, and researching what it means to be a Software Developer, I knew this was the career path for me.</p>

<!-- Main Webpage Paragraph No. 4 -->    
    <p class="image-text4"> Creating the opportunity for me to pursue a career in tech was an exercise in patience, and a lesson that will shape the rest of my life. I had made up my mind to quit my job as a Litigation Paralegal to enroll in Thinkful's bootcamp course on the same day my wife presented me with a positive pregnancy test. We both decided that I should probably keep my job and back-burner the bootcamp idea. Thirty-nine weeks later my wife gave me to greatest gift I could have ever received - a beautiful baby girl. Now, before our daughter starts walking (fingers crossed), and our savings runs dry, I am hoping to compelete this course, and begin a career as a Software Developer.</p>
